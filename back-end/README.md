## Starting the Backend Server

To start the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Backend Directory
2. Install Dependencies (if not already done) by running
```
npm install
```

3. Start the Server in Development Mode by running
```
npm run dev
```
This command utilizes `nodemon` to run the `server.js` file. It automatically restarts the server whenever you make changes to your backend code, making the development process more efficient.

### Testing
Backend testing details can be found in [back-end/test/README.md](back-end/test/README.md) file.
