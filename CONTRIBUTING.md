# Contribution Rules and Regulations

## Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in the NYUAD Issue Resolution Platform. We appreciate your willingness to contribute and be a part of our project. This document provides guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and productive contributions.

## Team Values and Process

### Team Norms:

- **Open Communication**: We prioritize open communication. All team members and contributors should feel free to express their ideas, concerns, and feedback.
  
- **Mutual Respect**: Every member and contributor, irrespective of their role, should be treated with respect and dignity.

- **Commitment**: We expect team members and contributors to be dedicated and meet their deadlines.

- **Continuous Learning**: We encourage everyone to learn continuously, ask questions, and help each other grow.

### Git Workflow:

We follow the Feature Branch Workflow. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you're an external contributor, begin by forking the main repo.

2. **Clone Your Fork/Repo**: Once forked, clone your repository locally: `git clone [your-repo-link]`.

3. **Create a Feature Branch**: Before you begin making changes, create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b [branch-name]`.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Make and commit your changes locally.

5. **Push to Your Fork**: Once changes are committed, push them to your fork: `git push origin [branch-name]`.

6. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the main repo and open a new pull request. Be detailed in your PR description. Link any related issues or user stories.

7. **Review & Merge**: Once reviewed and if there are no conflicts, the team will merge your changes.

## Rules of Contribution:

- Ensure that your code does not break any existing functionality.
  
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
  
- Always pull the latest changes from the main repository before starting work on a new feature.
  
- Always create a new branch for your feature. Do not commit to the main branch.
  
- If you find a bug or want to suggest an enhancement, please open an issue in the repository first.

## Setting Up Local Development Environment:
